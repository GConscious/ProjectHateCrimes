Whether the project can be run directly in the Ed Workspace.
1. The project cannot be run directly in Ed because of the large datasets we utilized. Our team used PyCharm and GitHub for our collaboration purposes.
2. Our project used libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and plotly. In order to use them, they be must installed with an import statement at the beginning at the file.
3. Our code can be executed from the terminal by entering $ python "filename".
